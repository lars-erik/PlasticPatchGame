This is a game I made for the [42nd Ludum Dare compo](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42).

The year is 2018.

Humans have littered the oceans with plastic.
There is a huge plastic patch building up in the Pacific.
It's up to you to clean it up.
The governments will pay you cents for your efforts
so you can upgrade and get better.

Codewise the game is sadly a big mess. I wanted to do a JS build script and some proper unit testing, but I realised JavaScript is as broken as ever with new processes since a quarter ago. In any case, I had loads of fun building it, and I hope it can raise some awareness about that pesky plastic patch. 

Built with Three JS for GFX library. Used SFXR for sounds. Sprites are hand drawn with Clip Studio Paint (Formerly Anime Studio). I almost managed to squeeze in an hour or two for music, but then I realised I hadn't reinstalled Live etc. since the last cleaning of my basement box.

Big thanks to my wife for putting up with me prioritizing this over family this week-end. :)

Hope you enjoy it.
